# Vulnerability Detection and Exploitation Tool

This tool allows for the detection and exploitation of various vulnerabilities in web applications. It includes scripts to handle input/output tasks, SQL Injection, XSS, IDOR, SSRF, File Inclusion, Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities, and more.

## Scripts

1. **vd.py**: Handles foundational tasks such as copying content and running additional scripts.
2. **ve.py**: Detects SQL Injection, XSS, document access, and user data access vulnerabilities.
3. **cut.py**: Tests for IDOR, XSS, SSRF, File Inclusion, and Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities.
4. **BabyT.py**: Orchestrates the running of the other scripts and produces a final comprehensive report.

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

1. **vd.py**: 
    - First, prepare the environment by running `vd.py`.
    - This script copies content from an input file to an output file and runs additional tasks if specified.
    - Produces a report in `vulnerability_reports/vd_report.txt`.

    ```sh
    python vd.py
    ```

    **Input Prompts**:
    - Path to the input file
    - Path to the output file
    - Paths to additional task scripts (optional)

2. **ve.py**:
    - Next, run `ve.py` to detect SQL Injection, XSS, document access, and user data access vulnerabilities.
    - Produces individual reports for each type of vulnerability in the `vulnerability_reports` directory.

    ```sh
    python ve.py
    ```

    **Input Prompts**:
    - Path to the file for detected vulnerabilities
    - Check for document access (yes/no)
    - Check for user data access (yes/no)

3. **cut.py**:
    - Finally, run `cut.py` to test for IDOR, XSS, SSRF, File Inclusion, and Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities.
    - Produces individual reports for each type of vulnerability in the `vulnerability_reports` directory.

    ```sh
    python cut.py
    ```

    **Input Prompts**:
    - Path to the file for detected vulnerabilities
    - Paths to additional task scripts (optional)

4. **BabyT.py**:
    - Orchestrates the running of `vd.py`, `ve.py`, and `cut.py` in the correct order.
    - Prompts the user to load output files from previous steps.
    - Produces a final comprehensive report combining all individual reports.

    ```sh
    python BabyT.py
    ```

    **Workflow**:
    - Run `vd.py` first.
    - Prompt to load the output file into `ve.py`.
    - Run `ve.py` next.
    - Prompt to load the report into `cut.py`.
    - Run `cut.py`.
    - Compile and generate a final report.

### Final Report

The final comprehensive report generated by `BabyT.py` includes detailed information about all discovered vulnerabilities, including:

- **Bug Type**: Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
- **Bug Location**: Specific location in the site where the vulnerability was found.
- **Description**: Description of the vulnerability.
- **How to Replicate**: Steps to replicate the vulnerability.
- **Solution**: Suggested solution to fix the vulnerability.
