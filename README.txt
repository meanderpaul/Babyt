Comprehensive Vulnerability Testing (CUT)
Overview
CUT (Comprehensive Vulnerability Testing) is an advanced tool designed to identify and escalate various security vulnerabilities in an application. It combines detection and exploitation techniques to provide a thorough security assessment.

Features
Detection:

Reads detected vulnerabilities from a file.

Automated Exploitation:

Uses specific payloads to test different vulnerabilities.

Dynamic scanning of endpoints.

Vulnerability Tests:

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Local/Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)

Privilege Escalation

XSS Escalation Techniques:

Session Hijacking

Phishing

Keylogging

Stealing Sensitive Data

Defacement

Contextual Risk Assessment:

Evaluates business and user impact.

Logging and Reporting:

Logs each step and generates a comprehensive report.

Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:

bash
pip install requests
Usage
Prepare an Input File: Create a text file with detected vulnerabilities. Each line should follow the format: endpoint,param,vuln_type.

Run the Program: Execute the script with the file path to the input file.

bash
python cut.py
Example Input File
https://example.com/search,query,XSS
https://example.com/login,username,SQL Injection
https://example.com/profile,user_id,IDOR
Output
The program logs all actions and results to a file named combined_vulnerability_report.log.
