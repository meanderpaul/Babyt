README for vulnerability_detection.py
Vulnerability Detection Program
Overview
This program scans for potential vulnerabilities in a given application by analyzing specified endpoints and parameters. It identifies common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).

Features
SQL Injection Detection: Identifies possible SQL injection points.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection: Detects potential XSS vulnerabilities.

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Detection: Finds IDOR vulnerabilities.

Logging: Logs all detected vulnerabilities for further analysis.

Usage
Input File: Prepare a text file with endpoints and parameters to test.

Run the Program: Execute the script with the file path to the input file.

bash
python vulnerability_detection.py
Example Input File
https://example.com/search,query,XSS
https://example.com/login,username,SQL Injection
Output
The program logs detected vulnerabilities to a file named vulnerability_detection.log.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

requests library

Installation
bash
pip install requests
Notes
Ensure you have authorization to test the application for vulnerabilities.

README for vulnerability_escalation.py
Vulnerability Escalation Program
Overview
This program attempts to escalate detected vulnerabilities by performing advanced tests. It focuses on exploiting identified vulnerabilities to understand their impact.

Features
SQL Injection Escalation: Attempts to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Escalation: Tries to exploit XSS vulnerabilities.

Document Access Check: Probes for accessible documents or configuration files.

User Data Access Check: Tests if user data can be accessed through vulnerabilities.

Logging: Logs all results and actions taken during the escalation process.

Usage
Input File: Prepare a text file with detected vulnerabilities.

Run the Program: Execute the script with the file path to the input file.

bash
python vulnerability_escalation.py
Example Input File
https://example.com/search,query,XSS
https://example.com/login,username,SQL Injection
Output
The program logs all actions and results to a file named vulnerability_escalation.log.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

requests library

Installation
bash
pip install requests
Notes

README for cut.py
Comprehensive Vulnerability Testing (CUT)
Overview
CUT (Comprehensive Vulnerability Testing) is an advanced tool designed to identify and escalate various security vulnerabilities in an application. It combines detection and exploitation techniques to provide a thorough security assessment.

Features
Detection:

Reads detected vulnerabilities from a file.

Automated Exploitation:

Uses specific payloads to test different vulnerabilities.

Dynamic scanning of endpoints.

Vulnerability Tests:

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Local/Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)

Privilege Escalation

XSS Escalation Techniques:

Session Hijacking

Phishing

Keylogging

Stealing Sensitive Data

Defacement

Contextual Risk Assessment:

Evaluates business and user impact.

Logging and Reporting:

Logs each step and generates a comprehensive report.

Usage
Input File: Prepare a text file with detected vulnerabilities.

Run the Program: Execute the script with the file path to the input file.

bash
python cut.py
Example Input File
https://example.com/search,query,XSS
https://example.com/login,username,SQL Injection
Output
The program logs all actions and results to a file named combined_vulnerability_report.log.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

requests library

Installation
bash
pip install requests
Notes
Ensure you have authorization to test the application for vulnerabilities.
